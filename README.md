# RememberTheScreenshot

What does it do?
- It makes a Screenshot of an area your choice, saves the position and size to reuse the same area again.
- Crop freely or use 16:9 or 1:1 ratio for the area's size

What is special about this?
- It keeps the Position and size of that area for future screenshots to provide a more uniform collection of screenshots.

Why another screenshot app?
- Its free, has no ads, does not required to be installed and has no other functions that would not be used.
